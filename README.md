/bgc img1.png

The image will be set.

### /status

Will return the bot's current status. 

### /ms (query)

### /mode 

Switch Terry between a chat bot and a search bot. By default, Terry is a search bot. He will inform you of his current stage after running /mode. 

Example 1: /mode is run for the first time. 

Terry will respond to chats like a chat bot. 

Example 2: /mode is run for a second time. 

Terry will NOT respond to chats like a chat bot and will instead google every query, or respond only to commands.
